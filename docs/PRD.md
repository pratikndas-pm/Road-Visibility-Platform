# 🧭 Product Requirements Document (PRD)
### Road Visibility Platform — AI-Powered Real-Time Shipment Tracking & Predictive ETA Engine

---

## 1. 📌 Overview

The **Road Visibility Platform (RVP)** is a **real-time shipment visibility and predictive analytics platform** that empowers logistics providers, freight forwarders, and port operators to track, predict, and optimize road-based cargo movements.  

RVP consolidates **telematics data**, **OEM feeds**, and **port/TMS events** into a unified visibility layer, enhanced by **machine learning (ML)** for ETA prediction and **AI** for conversational insights.  

The goal is to transform how supply chain operators **plan, react, and communicate**, through proactive, data-driven decisions rather than reactive follow-ups.

> **Vision:** Become the “Project44 of Emerging Markets,” offering predictive, transparent, and AI-augmented logistics visibility at scale.

## 3. 🧩 Problem Statement

Logistics companies today lack **end-to-end visibility** across fragmented data sources like carrier TMS, OEM telematics, EDI feeds, and port systems.  

- Shipments often move through multiple platforms without synchronization.  
- ETAs are estimated manually, leading to inaccuracy and customer frustration.  
- Control tower teams rely on static reports, missing real-time insights.  
- Delays, diversions, or idle time go unnoticed until escalation.  

The result: **inefficient resource allocation, delayed handovers, and lost revenue opportunities.**

---

## 4. 💡 Proposed Solution

The **Road Visibility Platform** introduces a **real-time, AI-augmented control tower** that provides:  
1. **Unified visibility** of shipments from multiple telematics and port sources.  
2. **Predictive ETA** using ML models (traffic, weather, congestion).  
3. **Automated exception management** (delays, deviations, idling).  
4. **AI chatbot assistant** for instant natural-language shipment queries.  
5. **APIs and SDKs** for partner and ERP integration.  

This platform replaces **manual tracking** with **predictive logistics intelligence**, providing operational clarity across stakeholders.

### 6.2 Predictive ETA Engine
- ML model trained on route history, traffic, weather, and port wait times.  
- Predict ETA ± confidence interval.  
- Auto-retrain weekly or on model drift > 5%.

### 6.3 Exception Management
- Delay alert if deviation from predicted ETA > 30 min.  
- Route deviation alert if distance > 10 km.  
- Support multi-channel alerting (email, Slack, SMS).  
- Assign exception tickets in the internal queue for triage.

### 6.4 AI Chatbot Assistant
- RAG-based GPT model to handle operator queries like:  
  > “Where is container ABX123?”  
  > “Which shipments are running late?”  
  > “Show ETA variance for today’s routes.”  
- Integrate with dashboard via floating widget (Dock UI).  
- Context-aware answers from data lake + model output.

### 6.5 KPI Dashboard
- Visualize metrics like on-time %, average delay, ETA accuracy.  
- Filters by carrier, region, shipment type, and time range.  
- Export reports to CSV, PDF, or Power BI.  

### 6.6 APIs & Integrations
- `/api/v1/shipments` → Shipment list + status  
- `/api/v1/eta/:id` → Predictive ETA + confidence  
- `/api/v1/alerts` → Active delays + risk summaries  
- `/ws/updates` → WebSocket stream for live events
