# 🚚 Road Visibility Platform  
*AI-powered Predictive Logistics Platform for Real-Time Shipment Tracking & ETA Insights*

> **Mission:** Deliver predictive logistics visibility that’s accurate, automated, and intelligent — enabling every shipper, carrier, and port to see, act, and optimize in real time.

---

## 🌍 Executive Summary

The **Road Visibility Platform (RVP)** is a **real-time shipment tracking and predictive ETA engine** designed for freight forwarders, 3PLs, and port operators.  
It merges **IoT telematics, OEM data, EDI feeds, and AI** into one unified control tower — reducing operational inefficiencies, delays, and manual interventions.

---

## ⚠️ Problem

Modern logistics faces:
- Disconnected visibility across multiple carriers and telematics systems.  
- Unreliable ETAs and manual follow-ups with drivers or ports.  
- No proactive alerts for delays, deviations, or congestion.  
- Lack of predictive insights or automated exception management.  

> On average, 30–40% of shipment-related time is wasted due to manual tracking and lack of predictive analytics.

---

## 💡 Solution

A **data-driven platform** that provides unified visibility and predictive intelligence for logistics operations.

**Core Outcomes:**
- **Predictive ETAs** with ML models trained on route, weather, and congestion data.  
- **Real-time alerts** for route deviation, idle status, or system downtime.  
- **AI Chatbot** for shipment lookup (“Where is my container?”).  
- **KPI dashboard** for operational and commercial metrics.  
- **APIs** for integration with TMS, ERP, and OEM telematics.
