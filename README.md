# 🚚 Road Visibility Platform  
*AI-Driven Shipment Tracking, Predictive ETA, and Logistics Visibility Engine*

---

## 🌍 Overview
The **Road Visibility Platform** is a real-time visibility and predictive ETA engine designed for logistics providers, freight forwarders, and port operators.  
It integrates telematics, OEM feeds, TMS events, and contextual data (traffic, weather, and geofences) into a unified control tower that helps logistics teams make faster and smarter operational decisions.

> 🎯 **Vision:** To be the “Project44 for emerging markets” — delivering transparency, predictability, and automation in global logistics.

---

## ⚠️ Problem
1. Fragmented tracking data across multiple telematics and OEM systems.  
2. Inaccurate ETA estimates causing poor planning and demurrage costs.  
3. Manual status checks that delay customer responses.  
4. Lack of proactive alerts for delays or deviations.  
5. Absence of contextual intelligence (traffic, weather, port congestion).

---

## 💡 Solution
A **data lake + AI-powered API layer** that consolidates shipment, telematics, and event data to provide:  
- **Predictive ETAs** powered by ML models.  
- **Automated delay alerts** and deviation detection.  
- **Conversational shipment assistant** for “Where is my container?” queries.  
- **API access** for TMS/ERP integrations.  
- **Analytics & KPIs dashboard** for performance insights.
