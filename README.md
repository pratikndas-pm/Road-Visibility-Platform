# 🚚 Road Visibility Platform  
*A Real-Time Shipment Tracking & Predictive ETA Engine Inspired by Project44 and Cargoes Flow*

---

## 🌍 Overview
The **Road Visibility Platform** unifies real-time shipment tracking, predictive ETA modeling, and AI-powered assistance into a single dashboard.  
It bridges fragmented logistics data — across **telematics, OEM, and port systems** — giving freight forwarders, shippers, and logistics teams **complete visibility and control** over cargo in motion.

> 🎯 **Mission:** Transform traditional logistics tracking into a data-driven, predictive visibility ecosystem.

---

## ⚠️ Problem
- Disconnected systems cause **visibility gaps** across fleets, TMS, and ports.  
- ETAs are **unreliable**, leading to planning inefficiencies.  
- Operators spend hours on **manual shipment status updates**.  
- Lack of **contextual insights** (traffic, weather, congestion).  

---

## 💡 Solution
A **data lake + API aggregator** that merges telematics feeds, TMS events, and geofences into one predictive visibility engine.

**Key Outcomes**
- Unified visibility across all carriers and regions.  
- Machine-learning–based ETA prediction with continuous retraining.  
- Exception alerts for delays, deviations, and offline vehicles.  
- AI chatbot for natural-language shipment queries.  
- Plug-and-play APIs for integration with CRMs, ERPs, and community systems.
