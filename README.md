# 🚚 Road Visibility Platform  
*AI-powered Predictive Logistics Platform for Real-Time Shipment Tracking & ETA Insights*

> **Mission:** Deliver predictive logistics visibility that’s accurate, automated, and intelligent — enabling every shipper, carrier, and port to see, act, and optimize in real time.

---

## 🌍 Executive Summary

The **Road Visibility Platform (RVP)** is a **real-time shipment tracking and predictive ETA engine** built for freight forwarders, 3PLs, and port operators.  
It merges **IoT telematics, OEM data, EDI feeds, and AI** into one unified control tower — reducing operational inefficiency, delays, and customer uncertainty.

---

## ⚠️ Problem

Modern logistics struggles with:
- Fragmented systems and disconnected visibility layers  
- Unreliable ETAs and manual follow-ups  
- Limited real-time insight into exceptions or deviations  
- No predictive analytics for delay or risk forecasting  

> Operators lose up to 25 % of productivity due to fragmented shipment visibility.

---

## 💡 Solution

A **data-driven visibility platform** that aggregates telematics, OEM, and port data to deliver:
- Predictive ETA with confidence intervals  
- Proactive delay and deviation alerts  
- AI chatbot for instant shipment answers  
- Live dashboard with KPIs and analytics  
- REST + WebSocket APIs for integration with TMS/ERP systems
