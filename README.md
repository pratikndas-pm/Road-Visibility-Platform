# 🚚 Road Visibility Platform  
*AI-powered Predictive Logistics Platform for Real-Time Shipment Tracking & ETA Insights*

> **Mission:** Deliver predictive logistics visibility that’s accurate, automated, and intelligent — enabling every shipper, carrier, and port to see, act, and optimize in real time.

---

## 🌍 Executive Summary

The **Road Visibility Platform (RVP)** is a **real-time shipment tracking and predictive ETA engine** inspired by **Project44** and **Cargoes Flow**, purpose-built for freight forwarders, 3PLs, and port operators.  
It brings together **IoT telematics, OEM feeds, EDI events, and AI** into one unified control tower — reducing uncertainty, manual intervention, and demurrage costs.

---

## ⚠️ Problem

Modern logistics suffers from:
- Fragmented systems and siloed telematics data.  
- Unreliable ETAs leading to costly delays.  
- Manual “Where is my container?” workflows.  
- No predictive visibility or contextual alerting (traffic, weather, route deviation).  

> Operators spend 35–40% of their time on avoidable status checks.

---

## 💡 Solution

A **data lake + ML-powered API aggregator** that consolidates multi-source logistics data to deliver:
- **Predictive ETAs** (AI/ML-driven with confidence intervals)  
- **Real-Time Exception Alerts** (delays, deviations, offline events)  
- **RAG-based AI Chatbot** for instant shipment insights  
- **KPI dashboards** for operations and business intelligence  
- **APIs & SDKs** for partner integration
